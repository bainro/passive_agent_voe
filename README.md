How to use:

```
cp agent_voe.py <path/to/mcs_eval3>
cp agent_util.py <path/to/mcs_eval3>
python agent_voe.py
```

It only requires that file and agent_util.py. The other files are  included in case someone finds them useful...

It has also been built and tested inside mcs_eval3, not in this git repo.
